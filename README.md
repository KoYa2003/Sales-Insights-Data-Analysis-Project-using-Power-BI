Project: Sales Insights of Data Analysis-AtliQ Hardware Using Power BI

## Problem statement

AtliQ Hardware is a company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals to various clients, including surge stores and Nomad stores, across India. The company's head office is located in Delhi, India, with several regional offices throughout the country.

The sales director of AtliQ Hardware is encountering numerous challenges due to the dynamically growing market. One of the major issues is effectively tracking sales amidst this dynamic growth, leading to a decline in overall sales. The sales director relies on regional managers for North India, South India, and Central India to provide insights into their respective regions. However, these insights are communicated verbally, lacking concrete evidence and data-backed analysis.

This lack of data-driven decision-making frustrates the sales director, as he cannot accurately assess the business's state and identify improvement areas. Given the size and complexity of AtliQ Hardware's operations, it's imperative to have a comprehensive understanding of sales performance across regions.

To address these challenges and enable data-driven decision-making, the sales director seeks to implement a simple data visualization tool, accessible daily. By leveraging such tools and technology, the company can gain actionable insights into its sales performance, leading to informed decisions to increase sales.

Therefore, this project aims to develop a custom sales dashboard using Power BI, tailored to AtliQ Hardware's specific needs. This dashboard will provide real-time visibility into sales metrics, regional performance, and trends, empowering the sales director and other stakeholders to make informed decisions to drive business growth.
